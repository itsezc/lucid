# Lucid

Lucid helps build & ship apps that scale infinitely with maximum performance, in record time with amazing DX and flexibility.

Backends can be very complex, expensive, and non-performant. Lucid helps solve these problmes by providing you with a framework that replaces the need for one; by leveraging SurrealDB, a powerful, all-in-one database engine with a typed abstraction acting as an ORM. This means you don't pay for servers (other than your database), most of the logic is executed on SurrealDB (which is made with Rust and highly performative) and provides full typing so you can focus on your UX and business.
