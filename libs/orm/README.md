# Surreal ORM

Surreal ORM assists you in building type safe apps with SurrealDB, without the need for a backend (although, you could have one), it is platform and framework agnostic meaning it can run anywhere: React, React Native, Svelte, Tauri, Tauri Mobile, Cloudflare Workers, Bun and more.

*This project is in alpha and WIP, it targets the Surreal nightly and therefore extends the relevant feature set. While we are in ALPHA the API is likely to change frequently - although we try our best not to - we suggest reading the CHANGELOGs and examples for the best understanding. The primary target runtimes are the browser, Bun and Cloudflare workers.*

### Design goal

1) Write your models and logic in Surreal ORM, ideally in its own package: `@org/models`
2) Write your frontend / backend, import `@org/models` and start using Surreal as a web database

## Features
- [x] Designed with type safety (w/ TypeScript) and performance in mind, with a very slim runtime (~10 KB)
- [x] Modeling 
	- 游릭 Permissions
	- 游릭 Assertions
	- 游릭 Events
	- 游릭 Overrides (`name`, `flexible` etc.)
	- 游릭 Indexes
- [x] `Query`, `Create`, `Update` and `Delete` with fully typed Models
- [x] `RELATE` between Models with type safety
- [ ] `sql` function as an escape hatch for edge cases, with optional type safety
- [x] Build advanced queries using `SELECT` with type guarantees
- [x] Schema generation with CLI and CI / CD pipelines
- [x] Works on the Browser, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Node.js
- [x] 1:1 Surreal types - `Primitives` (string, int etc.) as well as `GeoJSON` (point, polygon, collection etc.)
- [x] Exposed operators and functions such as `Time`, `String`, `Array` etc. for utility functions
- [x] Scopes

### WIP
- [ ] Migrations - Auto generated and deterministic SQL with seeding
- [ ] Live query support
- [ ] Aggregrate analytics views
- [ ] Futures
- [ ] Test suite (for Bun)
- [ ] Plugins - Bring your own utility macros / functions

### Roadmap
- [ ] WASM/SWC migration for Runtime with additional optimizations
- [ ] `sql` Syntax hightlighting with type safety
- [ ] VSCode extension
- [ ] Permission devtools
